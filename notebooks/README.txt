The purpose of the notebooks folder is to have a central location for all notebooks aiding in the development of clever-rockies. The purpose of each notebook is listed below:

- TIU_datastore_SRT: this notebook is used to pull tagged, formatted, test TIU notes. These test notes can then be used in conjunction with steps 2-5.
- CLEVER_steps: this notebook automates the process of running steps2-5 (granted you've created the output folder beforehand).
