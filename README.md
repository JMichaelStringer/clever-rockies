# CLEVER (CL-inical EVE-nt R-ecognizer)

This repo includes the Python3 version of CLEVER code form [here](https://github.com/suzytamang/clever-sdoh/tree/master)

Create an output folder.
Run the shell scripts in each of the step folders under ./src. The scripts are provided as examples. 
Change the target concept and output folder as needed. 
Make sure that scripts retain their Unix file format. DOS line endings cause trouble.
Make sure that the scripts do not end with an empty line.
